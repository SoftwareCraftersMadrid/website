              <p><strong>The Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship<strong></p>

              <p>
                As aspiring Software Craftsmen we are raising the bar of professional
                software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft.
                Through this work we have come to value:
              </p>

              <p>Not only working software, but also well-crafted software</p>
              <p>Not only responding to change, but also steadily adding value</p>
              <p>Not only individuals and interactions, but also a community of professionals</p>
              <p>Not only customer collaboration, but also productive partnerships</p>
              <p>That is, in pursuit of the items on the left we have found the
                items on the right to be indispensable.</p>
